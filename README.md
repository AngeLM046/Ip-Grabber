# Ip-Grabber

You need node js installed to run this.
When your victim clicks on the link it'll get their public ip address, fetch it to express.js server and redirect the victim to another url.

Use url_setter.py to set the ngrok/server url and redirect url.
You can also manually set it by changing the payload.txt file and saving it as index.html in public directory.

After you've set up the links, you're ready to run server.js and that's it.
